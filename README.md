# The only true ~/.emacs.d config

This is my 4th emacs configuration, starting from scratch. This time I'm trying to keep things minimal and only add them when I find the need for them, instead of installing every single plugin in the universe.

To install simply clone the repo

    $ git clone https://github.com/darthdeus/emacs-rebirth ~/.emacs.d
