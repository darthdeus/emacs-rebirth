# The only true ~/.emacs.d config

This is my 4th emacs configuration, starting from scratch. This time I'm
trying to keep things minimal and only add them when I find the need for
them, instead of installing every single plugin in the universe.

To install simply clone the repo

    $ git clone https://github.com/darthdeus/emacs-rebirth ~/.emacs.d

So far this configuration is mostly setup for doing Haskell development.
There is a small amount of config for Rails, but not yet fully usable.

The main focus is on enabling `evil-mode` in order to get the same
benefits of editing as when using VIM, but to keep the interactivity of
emacs, such as the Interactive Haskell Mode.
